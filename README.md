# Lorenz_Attractor

Some of the code from the notebook is in the code folder. Poinc_map.py is a cool visual of the map!

Lorenz_RK4 simulates the Lorenz system of ODEs using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method of approximation with a 3D simulation.

The original pushes are on the branch called 'master.' I made a mistake and didnt push them to 'main,' then left them there. Ignore them unless needed.
