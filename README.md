# Lorenz_Attractor

Lorenz_RK4 simulates the Lorenz system of ODEs using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method of approximation.

The .py file is only a 3D simulation, similar to the version shown in class on 1/21/22, and the notebook includes the initial thoughts on a second part related to data streams.

The original pushes are on the branch called 'master.' I made a mistake and didnt push them to 'main,' then left them there. Ignore them unless needed.
