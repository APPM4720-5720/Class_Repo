# Lorenz_Attractor

This code simulates the Lorenz system of ODEs using the 4th order Runge-Kutta method of approximation. 

The .py file is only a 3D simulation, similar to the version shown in class on 1/21/22, and the notebook includes the initial thoughts on a second part related to data streams.
